    "Monte Carlo simulation is one of the most important algorithms with several applications in many fields, including quantitative finance as one of the most important. Specifically in finance, it can be used to price derivatives from all kinds such as options, futures, swaps, variance swaps, amongs other exotic ones. "

    "It consists of the calculation of repeated random samplings to make numerical estimations of unknown parameters, which in the case that matters to us is the log return of a given asset, for continuos time return, and consequently its price at the end of a simulation. The final objective is to apply the law of large numbers to obtain a value that is close to the final price of the derivative after M simulations of several trading periods. "
